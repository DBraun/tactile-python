# Tactile-Python

This library is a pure Python port of [tactile-js](https://github.com/isohedral/tactile-js), a library for representing, manipulating, and drawing isohedral tilings on the 2D plane. [Craig S. Kaplan](https://github.com/isohedral) created `tactile` and `tactile-js` based on his [PhD thesis](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/other/phd/).

See [`tactile`'s original README file](https://github.com/isohedral/tactile/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to use this library.

## Install

`pip install tactile`

## Demo

See `examples/demo.py` which requires [`p5`](https://p5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It will display random tilings in a window.
